After  months of experimentation with the feedback plate instruments, we we wery happy and proud to assemble a performance for the Only Connect festival in Trondheim. Here we utilized the finger mounted piezo technique to make a varied collection of instruments, also using part of the architecture of the gallery building at Gråmølna (Trondheim art museum). We played windows, staircases, polycarbonate plates, and bioplastic plates. Alex assembled a fantastic team of collaborators from KIT (The fine arts academy of NTNU) and her professional contacts. We also invited NTNU music technology students and music performance professionals.
