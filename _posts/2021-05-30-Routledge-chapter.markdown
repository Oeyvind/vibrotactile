We are proud to announce our chapter for the Routledge Handbook of Practice-Based Research. The chapter title is "FEEDBACK: Vibrotactile Materials Informing Artistic Practice" and will be published late 2021. We discuss the circular aesthetics of feedback systems, of bio degradable materials, of explorative and experimental prototyping, of the slightly uncontrollable in musical instruments and in the collaboration process, the polymorphous nature of cross-cutting and cross-disciplinary processes, of the precision of touch and the musical freedom of staged sonic props. Thanks to editor Craig Vear for his patience with our late incoming chapter!
