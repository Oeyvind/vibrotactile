<p>We have done some more experiments on what we thought would be highly predictable resonating objects and it seems some lessons are learned. For these experiments, we mounted the microphone on a finger so that we could probe different parts of the object. The exciter transducer was mounted stationary on the object. Previously, we had been doing some tests with beams of polycarbonate, thinking that the beams would ne highly predictable. Then again, in our experience, they seemed to have less interesting properties than plates (as expected, with vibration nodes in just one dimension), but also still being somewhat unpredictable. For this reason we turned to resonating strings in a music instrument, an object that we thought we would have a clear understanding of. The harmonics of a string are well described, for an introduction, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_harmonic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_harmonic</a>.
We did, however encounter some interesting deviations from what we could expect from an ideal string. Some of the partials was easily accessible, although not on the exact physical position where one might initially expect. Oftentimes a slight offset in position was needed with respect to the mathematical subdivision, although the activation point was not symmetrical around the mathematical subdivision. Other partials was not accessible, or they were replaced by higher partials within the same ratio (1/3 being replaced by 1/6). Resonances corresponding to the remaining string length did also occur, as in line 6) of the illustration. Finally, we also experienced other resonance potentials not intuitively related to the position on the string where we put the microphone.

All rational subdivisions of the string (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 3/4, etc) produce harmonic partials corresponding to the denominator of the subdivision. (Ilustration: Wikipedia)</em></p>
