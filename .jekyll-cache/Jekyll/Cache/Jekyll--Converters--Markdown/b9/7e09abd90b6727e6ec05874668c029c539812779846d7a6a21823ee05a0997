I"­<p>Investigating the resonance potential of the audio processing circuit without the plate. The software on screen shows the strongest frequency components in the audio signal. Notice the different feedback frequencies that can be produced by varying the pressure of the finger towards the transducer. It seems intuitive that we can produce harmonic partials with integer relationships, but how can we explain the glissando?</p>
